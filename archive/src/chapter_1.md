- from a community perspective, Rooch helps Web3 builders to build the roots of Web3 for different branches of users
- from an ecosystem perspective, Rooch creates a connection between crypto assets from different ecosystems and versatile Web3 DApps
- from a technical perspective, Rooch serves as the middle layer between all the Layer1 blockchains and all the Web3 DApps
