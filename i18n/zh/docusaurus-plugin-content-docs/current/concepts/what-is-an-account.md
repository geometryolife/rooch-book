# Account

帐户是识别用户的一种方式。账户由私钥生成，并由地址标识。帐户可以拥有对象，并且可以发送交易。每笔交易都有一个发送者，发送者由地址标识。

An account is a way to identify a user. An account is generated from a private key, and is
identified by an address. An account can own objects, and can send transactions. Every transaction
has a sender, and the sender is identified by an [address](./address.md).
